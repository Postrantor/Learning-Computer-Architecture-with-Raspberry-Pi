# Raster vs. Vector Graphics

All modern displays are a matrix of luminescent pixels with each pixel being a coloured dot or point at a particular screen location. Two different methods are used to describe how the dots are arranged on the screen to form an image. Images formed by these two methods are referred to as either raster graphics or vector graphics.

_Raster graphics_ are images with these characteristics:

- They are stored as an array of pixels, each of which is assigned a red-green-blue (RGB) colour value and (optionally) a transparency value. - They are generally simpler to conceptualise than vector graphics because the pixels are arranged in a dot matrix (a grid), sort of like colouring in squares on graph paper. However, large images require storage of much more data because instructions are required to specify the position and colour of each individual pixel. - They have _resolution_ typically determined by the number of dots per inch (dpi). Making the image larger decreases its quality and may result in the image looking blurry, as shown in Figure 10-2. - They are generally used for photographs and other images that require _continuous tone_: smoothly merging colours and shades as opposed to sharply outlined shapes.

_Vector graphics_ are images with these characteristics:

- They are stored as a collection of mathematically defined points, lines, curves, and fills. - They generally result in smaller files, because the mathematical formulas describe points, paths and fills instead of having to define the location and colour of each and every pixel. - They can be made larger without any loss of quality, as shown in [Figure 10-2](#13_9781119183938-ch10.xhtml#c10-fig-0002). - They are the preferred format for fonts, logos and illustrations that require smooth, well-defined edges and flat colours.

### 3D Graphics in Video Games

Alongside the research into computer graphics in the early 1950s, academics also began experimenting with games as part of their computer science and artificial intelligence research. The first computer game credited with a graphical output was _OXO_ in 1952. This was a noughts and crosses puzzle where the players used a rotary telephone controller to determine in which square to place their next move. In this game, which was developed by Alexander Douglas in Cambridge, the user played against the computer, and the noughts and crosses board was displayed on a simple CRT display.

Another early computer game with graphical output was _Tennis for Two_. Developed by William Higinbotham to alleviate the boredom of visitors to Brookhaven National Laboratory, the game allowed two people to play against each other. A side view of a tennis court was displayed on an oscilloscope and each user could deflect a moving ball to each other using their own controller, with a knob for navigation and a button-press to hit the ball. The circuit would correctly model the trajectory of the ball on hitting the edge of the screen or net, and simulate drag as the ball moved through the air. The game was popular with the public, but after two seasons was dismantled to allow the hardware to be reused for other projects. As with many of these early examples, interest and resources focused very much on research rather than the opportunity to commercialise these games.

Perhaps the first game to achieve widespread distribution was _Spacewar!_ Developed as a hack by Steve Russell and a group of friends at MIT, and inspired by the visual potential of the high-quality vector display of Digital Equipment Corporation’s (DEC’s) PDP-1, this two-player game involved user-controlled spaceships that could fire missiles at each other whilst manoeuvring around the gravitational well of a central sun. By the end of the 1960s, most U.S. university computer labs possessed a copy of the game, as DEC decided to distribute it as test software with every PDP-1. However, the huge $120,000 price tag meant that only 50 PDP-1s were ever made, thus limiting the game’s commercial viability despite its huge popularity.

As computer hardware became cheaper, the coin-operated game market could seriously consider introducing video gaming to the general public. In the early 1970s, arcade-game developers pioneered rich visual displays and electronic sound effects in an attempt to capture the imagination of the masses. Two engineers, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, introduced _Computer Space,_ a derivative of _Spacewar!,_ to the coin-operated arcades of California, but this ended up being too costly and too complex to succeed. However, after forming Atari Inc. together in 1972, Bushnell and Dabney created _Pong_. Similar to table tennis, _Pong_ was a two-player bat and ball game where each player attempted to direct a moving ball past their opponent on the other side of a net. Derived from a simple game provided with the Magnavox Odyssey, the world’s first home console, they decided to manufacture this for public distribution, and with 19,000 units sold it became the first arcade game to achieve commercial success. Arcades flourished throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, helping to fuel the growing popularity of video gaming and with it the promise of a bright future for computer graphics.

### Personal Computing and the Graphics Card

During the early 1970s, distributed video games were manufactured as single-purpose devices, designed and manufactured solely to play a single game. The problem with this approach was that consumers had to purchase a new device each time they wanted to play a new game. (_Pong_ was such a game.) By the mid-1970s manufacturers had a solution for this problem—the microprocessor. Games could be run on general-purpose computing hardware; each game was essentially a new set of instructions to be run by the microprocessor in the system and could be sold separately from the gaming unit. The first console of this kind was the Video Entertainment System (VES) released by Fairchild in 1976. Games were released as cartridges containing read-only-memory (ROM) and could be swapped and plugged into the VES console to form an equivalent electrical circuit to that previously built from discrete components. Although game design and translation to ROM code were very much specialist skills, the microprocessor, and therefore the computer, became the next gaming platform.

From the late 1970s onward, 3D graphics developed at a rapid pace, fuelled by users’ desire for more immersive experiences and more complex geometries to be modelled and animated in life-like ways. Many industries contributed to this dramatic and rapid advancement. For the purposes of this brief history, we’re focusing on the development of hardware for the personal computer.
