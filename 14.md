# 3D Graphics

**HISTORICALLY, THE UNDERSTANDING** of classical computer systems architectures has focused squarely on the interaction between the central processing unit (CPU) and the memory infrastructure. However, a new breed of system is upon us, in which the graphics processing unit (GPU) plays an integral role and is as important as both these key components.

As software developers and consumers have demanded increased photorealism from games and more complexity and fluidity from their user interfaces, the requirements of computer graphics have increased. The humble GPU has been catapulted from a simple line-drawing accelerator to a highly parallel, multithreaded subsystem in its own right, with such computing power that it has become integral to modern computer architectures.

However, to understand the potential of graphics technology we must focus on its primary purpose and make sense of it in the context of modern 3D graphics.

## A Brief History of 3D Graphics

Although William Fetter is credited with coining the term “computer graphics” to describe his work on human body animation with Boeing in the early 1960s, the origin of 3D graphics can be traced back to the 1950s and military flight simulators (see Figure 10-1). As early as 1951, the Whirlwind computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was being used as a visualisation tool. The Whirlwind computer allowed oscilloscope-style graphics with user input via a device resembling a _light pen_. The Whirlwind was developed as part of the U.S. Navy’s Airplane Stability and Control Analyzer (ASCA) project, and the digital computer provided a programmable flight simulation environment where radar information was used to superimpose an aircraft symbol on top of a set of pre-programmed geographical data points. The result was viewed on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display. By pointing the light pen at the CRT, the user could query the state of the aircraft, such as its location and speed.

A light pen is a photo-sensitive device, like a wand, which can be used to point to or highlight objects on a CRT screen in the same way a finger can be used on a touchscreen device.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s various parallel streams of research developed the ideas of computer-aided design (CAD) and visualisation. By the mid-1950s, IBM was able to demonstrate the first system capable of displaying vector graphics; the IBM 740 (CRT recorder) was attached to the IBM 701 (data processing system) to record a series of points onto 35-millimetre (mm) photographic film. With variations in exposure, these points could be captured as lines and curves, and with the use of special programming techniques, the 740 could be used to display alphanumeric symbols, graphs and simple shapes. This was fundamental to the advent of computer-aided graphical design, but for a rental price of $2,850 per month it was prohibitively expensive even for commercial use. General Motors had also begun research into CAD with IBM, and this collaboration resulted in the world’s first computer-aided drawing system, the DAC-1, in the early 1960s, which was also capable of scanning in drawings provided by the user.

Vector graphics involve using _geometrical primitives_ (simple graphical building blocks) based on mathematical expressions to represent graphical images.

### The Graphical User Interface (GUI)

In 1963, Ivan Sutherland, a PhD student at MIT, presented a thesis entitled “Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System”, which consolidated much of the research of the late 1950s and introduced the first graphical user interface (GUI). Using MIT’s TX-2 computer equipped with the man-machine graphic communication system, a user could draw lines and curves directly onto a point plotter display using a light pen. In addition to this being the first complete GUI for a computer, it also allowed the user to constrain the geometric properties of the shapes on the screen, such as line lengths and the angles between them. Sutherland is widely regarded as a founding father of object-oriented programming (OOP) and modern day GUIs. In the mid-1960s he began research into “remote reality” in the quest to replace camera images with computer-generated scenes; these were nothing more than wireframe models, but Sutherland’s work was pioneering in the field of virtual reality and, together with Dr David Evans, he created a company to market these vector systems using custom hardware and software.

During the late 1960s and 1970s, computer graphics technology was being applied in various fields. For example, in medical imaging, X-ray images were captured digitally and processed on computers before being displayed. NASA also commissioned General Electric to develop a real-time colour raster graphics system as part of a monitor to train astronauts. (See the nearby sidebar for an explanation of raster graphics.) However, the cost of these systems, though falling, meant that computer graphics were limited to military and well-funded commercial applications. It wasn’t until the advent of personal computing that this technology became of interest to everyone, and the result was the inevitable flurry of activity in the industry as companies sought to take control of a potentially lucrative market.
